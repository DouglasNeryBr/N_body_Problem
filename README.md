# N-Body Problem

This repository contains a project that explores the N-body problem, a fundamental challenge in physics and astronomy involving the prediction of the motion of multiple interacting bodies under the influence of physical forces.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, accompanied by visualizations stored as video files. Below is an explanation of the repositoryâ€™s structure:

### **1. Main Files**
- `N_body_Problem.ipynb`: The main notebook file containing all the code, explanations, and outputs related to the N-body problem.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the purpose, structure, and usage of the project.

### **2. Video Folders**
The project uses videos to illustrate outputs from specific notebook cells. These videos are stored in dedicated folders, structured as follows:

- Each folder corresponds to a specific cell in the notebook that generates or references a video.
- Folder names match the title or description of the respective notebook cell.
- Videos inside each folder are ordered sequentially to match their appearance in the notebook.

#### Example:
If a cell is titled `Simulation of 3-body system`, the corresponding folder will be named `Simulation_of_3_body_system/`, and the videos inside it will be ordered as:
- `video1.mp4`
- `video2.mp4`
- `video3.mp4`
- Matplotlib
- Other libraries specified in the notebook

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
