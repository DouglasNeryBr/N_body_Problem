# N-Body Problem

This repository contains a project that explores the N-body problem, a fundamental challenge in physics and astronomy involving the prediction of the motion of multiple interacting bodies under the influence of physical forces.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, accompanied by visualizations stored as video files. Below is an explanation of the repository’s structure:

### **1. Main Files**
- `N_body_Problem.ipynb`: The main notebook file containing all the code, explanations, and outputs related to the N-body problem.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the purpose, structure, and usage of the project.

### **2. Video Folders**
The project uses videos to illustrate outputs from specific notebook cells. These videos are stored in dedicated folders, structured as follows:

- Each folder corresponds to a specific cell in the notebook that generates or references a video.
- Folder names match the title or description of the respective notebook cell.
- Videos inside each folder are ordered sequentially to match their appearance in the notebook.

#### Example:
If a cell is titled `Simulation of 3-body system`, the corresponding folder will be named `Simulation_of_3_body_system/`, and the videos inside it will be ordered as:
- `video1.mp4`
- `video2.mp4`
- `video3.mp4`

### **3. Additional Resources**
- Any supplementary files (e.g., data, scripts) are stored in appropriately named directories.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DouglasNeryBr/N_body_Problem.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook N_body_Problem.ipynb
   ```

3. Navigate through the notebook to explore the code and visualizations. When reaching cells that reference videos, you can find the corresponding files in the relevant folder for playback.

4. To view a video, navigate to the folder matching the cell’s name and play the desired video file using your preferred media player.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other libraries specified in the notebook

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
